    <p class="content">French toast is a classic breakfast dish made by soaking slices of bread in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and sometimes sugar and vanilla, then frying them in a pan until golden brown. The result is a warm, slightly crispy exterior with a soft and custardy interior. It is often served with toppings like syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, or whipped cream, making it a sweet and indulgent breakfast option.</p>

    <p class="content"> The origins of French toast date back centuries, with versions of the dish found in many cultures. In some variations, it’s made with stale bread to prevent waste, transforming leftovers into a delicious meal. While traditionally a sweet dish, savory versions can also be made by omitting sugar and adding ingredients like cheese or herbs. French toast’s versatility and ease of preparation have made it a beloved breakfast choice around the world.</p>
