     <p class="content">Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich fillings such as meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. Traditionally, it features a meat-based ragù sauce (often made with ground beef or pork), a creamy béchamel sauce, and generous amounts of cheese like mozzarella and Parmesan. Each layer is carefully stacked, then baked in the oven until the flavors meld together, creating a hearty, comforting meal. Lasagna’s versatility allows for variations, including vegetarian versions with vegetables and ricotta cheese or even seafood-based options.</p>
     <p class="content">The dish is typically served as a main course, with its origin tracing back to Italy, though it has since become a beloved comfort food around the world. The combination of savory sauces, tender pasta, and melted cheese makes lasagna a satisfying, flavorful dish that’s often made for gatherings or special occasions. Its appeal lies in its adaptability, with countless variations and regional takes that suit a wide range of tastes.</p>
